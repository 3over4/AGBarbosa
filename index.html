          <p>“The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers.” – Sydney J. Harris.
            <br>Hello, my name is André Gomes Barbosa. I have recently graduated from FEUP with a Master’s degree in computer science and engineering at the age of 23. In my 5º and last year as an engineering student I
            decided to create my very own personal page with the purpose to enlighten anyone who might be willing to contact me but don’t quite have that information or a clear idea of my background. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>After graduating from college, I found myself in the role of a dedicated young professional who is taking a step into the job market. Further on I will be describing my qualifications at the present time but first I would like to
            ramble a little bit more about myself though.</p>
          <h3>Hometown</h3>
          <img class="image" src="images/casa.PNG" alt="542824567ffd6cad163fd515_casa.PNG">
          <p>My hometown is actually a really calm and quiet place. I’m natural from Viana do Castelo, Portugal but i grew up in a nearby village named Alvarães. I guess you could say it is a very unnoticeable and boring town; on the other hand it’s perfect
            to get away from the stressful days of the city every now and then.</p>
          <p>Contrary to what could be expected, i attended my basic school and high-school years in Esposende due to personal reasons.&nbsp; I’ve spent about 8 years in this small but marvellous city and met many people that I would never have otherwise.
            I know it wasn’t a lifetime but it sure felt like one. For that reason it’s not difficult to think of this city as a second home at times. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>2010&nbsp;•&nbsp; Present day</p>
            <p>AKA FEUP, it is known as one of the best (if not the best) and more demanding Engineering schools nationwide. And I can say for myself that, after those five years, there’s absolutely no room left to doubt this statement. I was really overjoyed
              when I got placed in this college. My overall grade turned out to be a 14 out of 20. I have concluded the Master's degree in September 2015 with the presentation of my thesis and finally started devoting myself to the
              job market.</p>

I was a just-above-average student. I attended Science Technologies course and eventually graduated with a overall score of 17 out of 20 values. My application mark to FEUP, however, was around 15.8 due to my native language’s grade which was one of my specific entry exams. Thankfully, I was at ease with Maths and the other classes so everything worked out.</p></a>

Over the past few years, studies point out that the use of games as a supplement to traditional learning is much more efficient and motivational than just using the traditional teaching method. These are called serious games. 
This work aims to extend and improve a previous game developed to learn software testing as the contents of the game are loaded from a XML file which would be separated from the game implementation. The game itself, iLearnTest, consists of several challenges which cover various themes regarding software testing learning.
Since the content is saved to and loaded from a separate file from the game implementation, it becomes easier to create and edit new levels or even new games for diferent topics, simply by editing a XML file. This new approach turns iLearnTest into a framework rather than a game in the sense that it is possible to use the same game(s) as templates for the learning process of a variety of themes.

			<h3>Project Management Laboratory – Bulla</h3>
			<p>The Bulla project originated from the idea of developing a system that allows a retail customer to verify the authenticity of products belonging to a certain brand or producer, using only an Android smartphone. With a system like this, both
            the customer and the producer gain benefits, since the customer will trust the producer’s product, thus increasing the reputation of that brand. On top of that, with the reading of tags that are imprinted in the labels of the products, it
            is possible to send to the system’s server the information of where and when the readings took place. This data collection gives the brand the opportunity to extract some valuable conclusions through the analysis of all the information collected.</p>

			<h3>Database and Web Applications Laboratory – MYT</h3>
            <p>MYT stands for “Manage your time” and, like the name suggests is a tool that functions like a timetable in order to help the user organize his/her schedule. The aim is to ease time and team members management, specially for college students.
              Hopefully, this app will allow students to organize their activities, managing and estimating the time need for each activity. FEUP students should also be able to load their current curricular units. The following are screenshots from an
              example account we used for presentation.</p>
