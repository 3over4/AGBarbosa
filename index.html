          <p>“The real danger is not that computers will begin to think like men, but that men will begin to think like computers.” – Sydney J. Harris.
            <br>Hello, my name is André Gomes Barbosa. I’m 21 years-old and I'm currently attending Master’s degree in computer science and engineering at FEUP. This is my 5º (and probably last) year as a computer science and engineering student and so I
            decided to create my very own personal page. The page’s purpose is to enlighten anyone who might be willing to contact me but don’t quite have that information or a clear idea of my background. Well never fear, I finally took my time to do
            this. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>This year I'll be writing/developing my college thesis; that is to say this will not only be my last year as a student ... but my first as a actual, dedicated professional who is taking a step into the job market. Before that, I would like to
            ramble a little bit more about myself though.</p>
          <h3>Hometown</h3>
          <img class="image" src="images/casa.PNG" alt="542824567ffd6cad163fd515_casa.PNG">
          <p>My hometown is actually a really calm and quiet place. I’m natural from Viana do Castelo, Portugal but i grew up in a nearby village named Alvarães. I guess you could say it is a very unnoticeable and boring town; on the other hand it’s perfect
            to get away from the stressful days of the city every now and then.</p>
          <p>Contrary to what could be expected, i attended my basic school and high-school years in Esposende due to personal reasons.&nbsp; I’ve spent about 8 years in this small but marvellous city and met many people that I would never have otherwise.
            I know it wasn’t a lifetime but it sure felt like one. For that reason it’s not difficult to think of this city as a second home at times. &nbsp;</p>

			<h3>Project Management Laboratory – Bulla</h3>
			<p>The Bulla project originated from the idea of developing a system that allows a retail customer to verify the authenticity of products belonging to a certain brand or producer, using only an Android smartphone. With a system like this, both
            the customer and the producer gain benefits, since the customer will trust the producer’s product, thus increasing the reputation of that brand. On top of that, with the reading of tags that are imprinted in the labels of the products, it
            is possible to send to the system’s server the information of where and when the readings took place. This data collection gives the brand the opportunity to extract some valuable conclusions through the analysis of all the information collected.</p>

			<h3>Database and Web Applications Laboratory – MYT</h3>
            <p>MYT stands for “Manage your time” and, like the name suggests is a tool that functions like a timetable in order to help the user organize his/her schedule. The aim is to ease time and team members management, specially for college students.
              Hopefully, this app will allow students to organize their activities, managing and estimating the time need for each activity. FEUP students should also be able to load their current curricular units. The following are screenshots from an
              example account we used for presentation.</p>

The following is a list of the tools that we were required to use during that time:<br><br>- Languages: C, C++, Java, UML, XML, HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript, JSON, SQL, PostgreSQL, Prolog, VDM++ e Scheme;<br>- Frameworks: Swing, jQuery, Android SDK;<br>- Operating Systems: Mostly Windows but also Linux;<br>- Version Control: Git and SVN;<br>- IDE’s: Visual Studio, Eclipse, Sparx Enterprise Architect;<br>- Methodologies: Scrum, Object-Oriented Programming, Test driven development;<br>- Other: Microsoft Office and LaTeX.</p></a>

            <h3>Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto<br>(College)</h3>
            <p>2010&nbsp;•&nbsp; Present day</p>
            <p>AKA FEUP, it is known as one of the best (if not the best) and more demanding Engineering schools nationwide. And I can say for myself that, after these four years, there’s absolutely no room left to doubt this statement. I was really overjoyed
              when I got placed in this college. However I also had crossed feelings about it. I mean, I was really lucky to be able to enter such a good college; on the other hand, the overwhelming amount of work made me feel ... not so lucky, at least
              until I was finally able to adapt. My overall grade at the moment is about 13.18 out of 20 which is perfectly average among our ranks, truth be told. I’m expecting to finish classes this year with my thesis and start devoting myself to the
              job market next year.</p>
            </a><a class="w-clearfix w-inline-block journal-entry"><h3>Escola Secundária Henrique Medina<br>(High-school)</h3><p>2007&nbsp; •&nbsp; 2010</p><p>Like mentioned before, I attended high-school in Esposende’s school. I was a just-above-average student. The reason for this is that I had not found any real motivation at this point, to be honest. I attended Science Technologies course and eventually graduated with a overall score of 17 out of 20 values. My application mark to FEUP, however, was around 15.8 due to my native language’s grade which was one of my specific entry exams. Thankfully, I was at ease with Maths and the other classes so everything worked out.</p></a>
